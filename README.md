# Telecom_Customer-churn_Prediction
Telecom Churn Prediction Project
Business Problem Overview
In the highly competitive telecom industry, customer churn is a critical concern. With an annual churn rate ranging from 15-25%, retaining high-profitable customers has become the top business goal for many telecom operators. Acquiring new customers is considerably more expensive than retaining existing ones, making customer retention a strategic priority.

To address this challenge, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at a high risk of churn. In this project, we will analyze customer-level data from a leading telecom firm, develop predictive models to identify high-risk churn customers, and uncover key indicators of churn.

Understanding and Defining Churn
Payment Models
The telecom industry operates on two main payment models: postpaid and prepaid. In the postpaid model, customers pay bills after using services, making churn detection relatively straightforward. However, in the prepaid model, customers can stop using services without notice, making churn prediction more critical and challenging.

Churn Definitions
Churn can be defined in various ways, and for this project, we will use a usage-based definition. This involves identifying customers who have not engaged in any usage (calls, internet, etc.) over a specified period.

Shortcomings of Definitions
Revenue-based Churn: Doesn't account for customers who use services but do not generate revenue, such as those receiving calls in rural areas.
Usage-based Churn: May be too late to take corrective actions if customers have already stopped using services by the defined period.
High-Value Churn
In the Indian and Southeast Asian markets, approximately 80% of revenue comes from the top 20% of customers, known as high-value customers. Reducing churn among high-value customers is crucial for minimizing revenue leakage. This project focuses on defining high-value customers based on specific metrics (to be mentioned later) and predicting churn exclusively among this segment.

Project Objectives
Analyze customer-level data from a leading telecom firm.
Build predictive models to identify high-risk churn customers.
Uncover key indicators of churn in the telecom industry.
Define high-value customers based on specific metrics.
Predict churn exclusively among high-value customers.
Dataset
The dataset provided includes customer-level information and usage data. Detailed exploration and preprocessing will be performed to prepare the data for model development.

Methodology
The project will follow a structured methodology involving data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation. Various machine learning algorithms will be employed to build predictive models, and the chosen metrics will be used to define high-value customers.

Deliverables
Jupyter notebook containing data analysis and model development code.
Presentation summarizing key findings and recommendations.
By the end of this project, we aim to provide actionable insights to the telecom company for reducing churn, particularly among high-value customers in the Indian and Southeast Asian markets.
